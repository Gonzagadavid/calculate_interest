#    Interest calculation :moneybag:  

The idea for this personal project came up when I had the need to calculate interest for a personal matter, immediately came the idea of building a program to calculate both detailed interest and compound interest and to display the calculations in detail when desired.

 With this project I was able to put into practice the following knowledge: 

-  Use of the toLocaleString () method to represent currencies according to the standard passed as a parameter;
-  DOM element manipulation;
-  Object-building function;
-  Obtain results through methods of the same construction function; 
-  Responsiveness of the page.

 I tried to leave the page design according to the theme, I hope you like it.
